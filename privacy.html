    <p>
      It is Fridge’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
      may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Fridge-2619646941384309"
        >https://www.facebook.com/Fridge-2619646941384309</a

      (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
      "https://www.facebook.com/Fridge-2619646941384309"). We respect your
      privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
      information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this
      privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be
      collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
      circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This
      Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website
      and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our
      Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of
      our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you
      may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
      Like most website operators, Fridge collects non-personally-identifying
      information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
      available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
      and the date and time of each visitor request. Fridge’s purpose in
      collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
      how Fridge’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Fridge may
      release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
      publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fridge also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
      comments on https://www.facebook.com/Fridge-2619646941384309 blog posts.
      Fridge only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the
      same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
      information as described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
      Certain visitors to Fridge’s websites choose to interact with SevTech,
      Inc. in ways that require Fridge to gather personally-identifying
      information. The amount and type of information that Fridge gathers
      depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
      sign up for a blog at https://www.facebook.com/Fridge-2619646941384309 to
      provide a username and email address.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
      that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
      Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
      partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
      recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
      compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
      information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
      advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
      Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Fridge and does not cover the
      use of cookies by any advertisers.
    </p>

    <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by
      us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third
      party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and
      terms and conditions of every site you visit.

      privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
      services.

    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
      Fridge discloses potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
      contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
      information in order to process it on Fridge’s behalf or to provide
      services available at Fridge’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to
      disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
      organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
      Fridge’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
      Fridge will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
      contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Fridge
      discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
      information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
      governmental request, or when SevTech, Inc. believes in good faith that
      disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
      Fridge, third parties or the public at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a registered user of
      https://www.facebook.com/Fridge-2619646941384309 and have supplied your
      email address, Fridge may occasionally send you an email to tell you about
      new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
      what’s going on with Fridge and our products. We primarily use our blog to
      communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
      email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support
      email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
      publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
      help us support other users. Fridge takes all measures reasonably
      necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
      destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information.
